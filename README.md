Plant Disease Classification Using ResNet

The farming sector plays a crucial role in feeding the global population, but one of the major challenges it faces is the management of plant diseases. This project discusses a ResNet model that detects plant diseases and classifies plant images into healthy or not healthy using PyTorch implementation. The model is trained using over 70000 pictures. The testing results show that the model was able to reach 99.23% Accuracy.
